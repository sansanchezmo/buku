# BUKU
Access your favorite books wherever you want.

Buku is a new alternative app for those who love to read and enjoy the literature. This project shows a new way to easily open a book and start reading everywhere. Buku was born with the idea of giving each person the opportunity to read well-known books without having to go to library or perhaps buy the book, read it once and never see it again.

With Buku you have the possibility to search for the book you want since it works with a powerful search engine and intuitive navigation. Also, you can search for some authors or even tags that the books have, that is if you want to find a specific topic to read. Once you have found your target you can enter a detailed description of the book, there you will find some information about it, rating and a comments section.

At Buku we know that the most important thing is to give our users the best possible experience, for that reason you will find a main page where you can explore a large number of new book, reading lists and some tags that may interest you.

In the Buku development team we are working very hard to give you our best and you can make the most of the world of literature. Remember that we are all Buku team, so please enjoy :D
# Getting started

If you want to start using Buku we will only ask you for an existing email, password and new nickname. It’s so easy, right? Once you have installed the Buku app you can either log in with an existing account or you can register. If you are new to the platform, we will send you an email so you can verify and get started with your new Buku profile.

As in buku we care about our new users, if it is the first time you start the application, you will see a “home page” where you can choose some Buku settings such as the theme, the profile image or tags you like.

Now you can use Buku as many times as you want and maybe use it on another device.

# Navigate inside Buku

Buku works with an intuitive navigation system so you can easily move around the application and find the correct sections. When you start the app, you will see the home page and a navigation bar at the bottom. Here you can take a look at some recommendations that the application makes depending on your tastes. The first part shows you individual book covers, and you can decide whether or not you are interested by sliding the image to the left or right. Below that widget, you will find an access to your "open books" history so that you can reopen your books. After that, you will find popular reading lists and tags that you might like.
## user sections
By sliding the whole page to the right, you will find the reading lists page. There you can see all the lists you already have, and it is possible to create new reading lists. Another right sliding and you will find your user profile, as you can see this screen shows all your public information and statistics. If you swipe down a bit there are some sliders showing your favorite books and authors, bellow you will see a tag cloud of your chosen tags. Another function of this page is that you can find the user settings where you can change you name, image, etc.
## searh engine and forum
Now let´s talk what if you swipe left the screen. Now you can see the search engine where you can look for the book, author or tag you want. Here you can filter your search by indicating the type of results you are expecting. Once you end writing the text to consult, it takes a while to show you a list of results where you can see the basic information of each element.

Then, you can tap into the Book result and open the book information page, here you will find helpful details about it such as the rating, user views and a small review. Also, if you scroll down you will see all the comments that other users make to that book. As you will notice, there is a floating button in the bottom. If you press that button, it shows you some options like comment, rate, buy this book or add to favorites. It is important to say that Buku does not sell books, it only sends you to an amazon or google book page so you can get the book.

The last section of the app is a forum that is not yet implemented, but Buku development team are working to update it for the next version.
